    abstract = {Statistical agencies face a dual mandate to publish accurate statistics while protecting respondent privacy. Increasing privacy protection requires decreased accuracy. Recognizing this as a resource allocation problem, we propose an economic solution: operate where the marginal cost of increasing privacy equals the marginal benefit. Our model of production, from computer science, assumes data are published using an efficient differentially private algorithm. Optimal choice weighs the demand for accurate statistics against the demand for privacy. Examples from U.S.{\textbackslash} statistical programs show how our framework can guide decision-making. Further progress requires a better understanding of willingness-to-pay for privacy and statistical accuracy.},

    abstract = {The foundation of the scientific method rests on access to data, and yet such access is often restricted or costly. We investigate how improved data access shifts the quantity, quality, and diversity of scientific research. We examine the impact of reductions in cost and sharing restrictions for satellite imagery data from NASA’s Landsat program (the longest record of remote-sensing observations of the Earth) on academic science using a sample of about 24,000 Landsat publications by over 34,000 authors matched to almost 3,000 unique study locations. Analyses show that improved access had a substantial and positive effect on the quantity and quality of Landsat-enabled science. Improved data access also democratizes science by disproportionately helping scientists from the developing world and lower-ranked institutions to publish using Landsat data. This democratization in turn increases the geographic and topical diversity of Landsat-enabled research. Scientists who start using Landsat data after access is improved tend to focus on previously understudied regions close to their home location and introduce novel research topics. These findings suggest that policies that improve access to valuable scientific data may promote scientific progress, reduce inequality among scientists, and increase the diversity of scientific research.},

            Journals have pushed for transparency of research through data availability policies. Such data policies improve availability of data and code, but what is the impact on reproducibility? We present results from a large reproduction exercise for articles published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, which has had a data availability policy since its inception in 2009. Out of 363 published articles, we assessed 274 articles. All articles provided some materials. We excluded 122 articles that required confidential or proprietary data or that required the replicator to otherwise obtain the data (44.5\% of assessed articles). We attempted to reproduce 152 articles and were able to fully reproduce the results of 68 (44.7\% of attempted reproductions). A further 66 (43.4\% of attempted reproductions) were partially reproduced. Many articles required complex code changes even when at least partially reproduced. We collect bibliometric characteristics of authors, but find no evidence for author characteristics as determinants of reproducibility. There does not appear to be a citation bonus for reproducibility. The data availability policy of this journal was effective to ensure availability of materials, but is insufficient to ensure reproduction without additional work by replicators.

            Résumé
              Les journaux militent pour la transparence de la recherche par le biais de politiques sur la disponibilité des données
              . De telles politiques sur les données améliorent la disponibilité des données et du code, mais quelle en est l'incidence sur la reproductibilité? Nous présentons les résultats d'un grand exercice de reproduction pour des articles publiés dans le
              American Economic Journal: Applied Economics
              , qui a une politique de disponibilité des données depuis sa création en 2009. Parmi les 363 articles publiés, nous en évaluons 274. Tous les articles avaient fourni certains documents. Nous avons exclu 122 articles qui nécessitaient des données confidentielles ou exclusives, ou qui exigeaient que la personne chargée de la réplication obtienne autrement les données (44,5\% des articles évalués). Nous avons tenté de reproduire 152 articles et avons réussi à entièrement reproduire les résultats de 68 articles (44,7\% des reproductions tentées). Nous avons aussi partiellement reproduit 66 autres articles (43,4\% des reproductions tentées). De nombreux articles nécessitaient de complexes changements de code, même lorsqu'ils étaient au moins partiellement reproduits. Nous avons recueilli les caractéristiques bibliométriques des auteurs, mais n'avons pas constaté qu'elles étaient déterminantes pour la reproductibilité. La reproductibilité ne semble offrir aucun avantage en matière de citations. La politique de disponibilité des données de ce journal a été efficace pour assurer la disponibilité des documents, mais insuffisante pour assurer la reproduction sans travail supplémentaire des personnes chargées de la réplication.},

Journal editors, in particular, have made a commitment to research transparency by issuing data policies that require authors to submit their data, code, and documentation to data repositories to allow for public access to the data. In the case of the American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Data Replication Policy, the data also must undergo an independent verification process in which materials are reviewed for quality as a condition of final manuscript publication and acceptance.Aware of the specialized expertise of the data archives, AJPS called upon the Odum Institute Data Archive to provide a data review service that performs data curation and verification of replication datasets. This article presents a case study of the collaboration between AJPS and the Odum Institute Data Archive to develop a workflow that bridges manuscript publication and data review processes. The case study describes the challenges and the successes of the workflow integration, and offers lessons learned that may be applied by other data archives that are considering expanding their services to include data curation and verification services to support reproducible research.},
